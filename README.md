# Welcome to our coding challenge!

First of all, thank you for taking the time, we really appreciate it :smile:

We carefully put together this coding challenge to asses your Javascript and React skills. We spent some time making it exciting so we hope you enjoy it.

## So, what's the challenge about?

As you can see, this repository is not empty, there is already some code in it. The code has been written by "an inexperienced developer" and we need your help taking a look at it.

We suspect the code is badly implemented and has many quality and performance problems. Your task is to find these problems in the code and fix them.

Of course, if you make any fixes or changes, we'll require you to explain about these changes, ultimately we want to understand your reasoning.

## How to tackle this challenge

- Clone this repository.
- You'll branch out from master, and start taking a look at the code locally.
- In the end of this readme there are instructions on how to run the project, but this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so it should be fairly straightforward.
- Please make [atomic commits](https://www.codewithjason.com/atomic-commits-testing/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAtomic%20commit%E2%80%9D%20is%20basically%20a,or%20two%20lines%20of%20code.) as a way of documenting your changes.
- The current implementation works as intended from an end user's perspective, so when making a change, please have a strong reasoning behind it.
- The deadline to finalize your changes will be right before our scheduled interview.

**Bonus points (these items are not required to be fully implemented, before moving to these, please finish reviewing the existing code)**:

- **Unit / Integration tests**:
  You can add unit or integration tests. It's not necessary to do it extensively, just enough to give us a sense of your testing strategy.
- **Viewing post comments**:
  We used [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to fetch some dummy posts to show in our application. You can use the same service to also fetch comments, and show them for each post. You can either fetch all comments or load comments per post.
- **Comment on a post**:
  There is a button to comment on each post that isn't working right now, you can implement it.
- **Deployment**:
  You can deploy this to a service of your choice.

These extra features have very loose requirements. The UI is up to you, but make it work first.

## How we review

During our interview you will have 30 minutes to present your changes to us. Please follow a coherent order for doing so. One or more of our engineers will be playing the role of the “inexperienced developer”, and will be very eager to know why the code was changed and how to improve, so be prepared, you'll need to be clear and confident with your explanations to our questions.

**We value quality over completeness**. It is fine to leave some things aside given you call them out in the interview.

Things we'll asses during the interview:

- **Problem comprehension**
- **Problem solving**
- **Agile mentality**
- **Quality mindset**
- **Clean code principles**
- **React and Javascript knowledge**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
